SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

In the parent folder of blockly, run

    git clone https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js.git

to clone the MIDI.js library.


DEMO LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Run

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

  from the *parent* of the blockly folder (the port number can be changed). This
  is because the soundfonts for MIDI.js need to be served from localhost and
  not directly from the file system -- see http://stackoverflow.com/a/33801287
  for details.

2. In a browser, navigate to the following URL:

    http://localhost:8888/blockly/demos/music/index.html
