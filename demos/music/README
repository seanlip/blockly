SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

This demo depends on the MIDI.js library. To set things up, navigate to the
*parent* of the blockly folder in a terminal, and run the following command in
order to clone MIDI.js:

    git clone https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js.git


DEMO LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Run

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

  from the *parent* of the blockly folder (the port number can be changed).
  This is because the soundfonts for MIDI.js must be served from localhost and
  not directly from the file system. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/33801287
  for details.

2. In a browser, navigate to the following URL:

    http://localhost:8888/blockly/demos/music/index.html
